In game it says Guardians should have 25% extra hp but it only gives 25 extra hp. This fixes that.

Installation:
Use with Chris's latest mod launcher version https://github.com/ChrisMiuchiz/Cube-World-Mod-Launcher/releases. Just put the LichModsGuardianFix.dll into your mods folder. Basically, your Cube World folder should contain "CubeModLoader.fip" and a "Mods" folder. Your "Mods" folder should contain LichModsGuardianFix.dll.
